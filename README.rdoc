== Process Generator

=== About the Generator

This program creates a set of processes (fake ones) to be used as test data for a OS project.  Feel free to use it as you please, it is simply a way for me to generate test data fast and randomly.

I originally did this in ruby because I knew the languange and it would be a lot easier then doing it in java or a C variant.  It worked quite well and I got it to work with little trouble.

I then wrote it in perl because myself and two other classmates/co-workers were going to be doing a programming competition, and at the last minute, decided to do it in perl (Java and gnu C++ being our only other options).  So I taught myself some perl and it retained similar functionality, and doesn't require any extra modules (I beileve that is what perl call them).'

=== Usage

Run the program by using:

  ruby process_gen.rb

Then follow the commands.  Here is a sample output:
  
  bash$ ruby process_gen.rb
  Enter the number of processes you want generated: 
  3
  Enter the name of the file you want the generated process stored in:
  sample
  bash$ cat sample
  0       22      0       44      25      3
  1       23      2       90      25      8
  2       40      0       18      46      1
  bash$

To run in perl:

  perl process_en.pl
  
Same functionality as the ruby application (I hope...).
